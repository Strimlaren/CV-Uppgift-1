# CV Site Uppgift 1 + 2
Contains my CV / Portfolio site which is also auto deployed to Netlify (link at bottom).

## Changelog for CV site since uppgift 1:
- CV is now loaded from a JSON file
- Code Jam Rock-Paper-Scissors game added and available for play directly from projects-page, also on published site
- Contact me page extended with contact form modal. Self-made vanilla-JS char counter can be found here
- Added external (heavily modified) JS code for animating progress bars on about.html
- Added readme.md. 

## Requirements:
- [x] Only vanilla JS allowed  
- [x] CV, workplaces and education infos must be in a separate JSON file  
- [x] JSON file should be loaded and generate your CV  
- [x] You page should contain at least one self-made interactive vanilla JS-element  
- [x] Integrate an external vanilla JS script to the site  
- [x] Add comments to mark what JS code is self-made / external. Provide link  
- [x] Add a portfolio page that shows all your projects  
- [x] Publish a Code Jam project to Github and include it to portfolio page

## Technical requirements:
- [x] Validated with 0 errors at [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/Links)
      NOTE: W3 Validator is complaining about duplicate classes which belong to an SVG which cannot be undone
      NOTE 2: Also, it is complaining about the width property i changed to 100% on the google maps iframe. This is intended
      NOTE 3: Additionally, it says a section lacks headlines. The headline pertaining this section lies just outside of it, for design purposes
- [x] No errors in console  
- [ ] SEO optimization
  - [x] Semantic HTML-tags
  - [ ] Meta-tags
  - [x] Optimized images
- [x] Add a readme.md in the repo root  
- [x] Link to (public) repo, containing all the code and readme.md

## Extra Challenge:
- [ ] Portfolio page should fetch from Github with API  
- [ ] While fetching projects it should show to the user that it is processing

## VG-requirements (code-quality):
- [x] Good structure  
- [x] Easy to read/follow code  
- [x] Clear variable, function and class naming  
- [x] Good semantics  
- [x] Good commit messages  
- [x] Good readme
